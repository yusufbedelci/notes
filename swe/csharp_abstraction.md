# C# Abstraction
Abstraction is a core principle in object-oriented programming that focuses on hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary features of an object to the outside world. In C# abstraction can be achieved through the use of [interfaces](csharp_interfaces) and [abstract classes](csharp_abstract_classes). This concept encourages the design of objects that interact in a clear and straightforward manner, allowing developers to work with more abstract concepts at a higher level. By emphasizing what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality, abstraction facilitates flexibility and scalability in software development.

## Abstraction and the *Observer Pattern*
Abstraction plays a crucial role in implementing various software design patterns, including the *Observer Pattern*.
